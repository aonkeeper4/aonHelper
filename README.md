yea this mod does stuff alright

current features:

- Resizable Heart
  - its a crystal heart. you can resize it too (pretty funky)
- Feather Dash Switch
  - dash switch except you bounce into it with a feather to activate it
- Feather Bounce Scam Controller
  - if your feather timer is low enough trying to bounce will uh instead Not Do That which is annoying
  - this fixes that (you can set the feather timer threshold to whatever u want)
- Rebound Modify Controller
  - modifies the player's Rebound method to preserve speed (does not launch u upwards in the same way tho)
- Fling Bird No Skip Controller
  - makes vanilla flingbirds not run away when you're too far past the node

note that most of these do not have sprites in loenn (womp womp) i will add these later hopefulyl
