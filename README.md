yea this mod does stuff alright

current features:

- Resizable Heart
  - its a crystal heart. you can resize it too (pretty funky)
- Feather Dash Switch
  - dash switch except you bounce into it with a feather to activate it
- Feather Bounce Scam Controller
  - if your feather timer is low enough trying to bounce will uh instead Not Do That which is annoying
  - this fixes that (you can set the feather timer scam threshold to whatever u want. including 0 for it not not happen at all)
- Rebound Modify Controller
  - modifies the player's Rebound method to set/conserve speed (allows for independent control of the x and y directions as well as top vs side rebounds)
- Fling Bird No Skip Controller
  - makes vanilla flingbirds not run away when you're too far past the node
- Fg Styleground Bloom Controller
  - allows you to apply bloom to foreground stylegrounds (either all of them or only ones with a certain tag)
- Unforgiving Spikes
  - spikes that kill you no matter what. basically pretty killboxes
- Clamp Light Color Controller
  - allows you to set the "maximum" light color, i.e. no light is allowed to have a color brighter than this. useful for when you want overlapping light sources to not blend into white

for all of the controllers listed here, just place it in the room where you want its effect. most of them have flag fields to only be active when a certain flag is set, if they dont or you want to report any other bugs or feature requests then ping me in celestecord (@aonkeeper4)

happy modding :glumbsup:
